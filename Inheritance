Inheritance : 
1 Parent class also knwn as Base class and Super class
2 Child class also knwn as Derived class and Sub class
3 Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behavior (methods) of an existing class.
4 The existing class is called the "parent class" or "superclass," and the new class is called the "child class" or "subclass."
5 Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
 

Syntax : 
 class A {
        // Parent class members (fields and methods)
 }
    class B extends A {
            // Child class members (fields and methods)
    }
